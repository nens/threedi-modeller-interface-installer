                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

In addition, as a special exception, the QGIS Development Team gives
permission to link the code of this program with the Qt library,
including but not limited to the following versions (both free and
commercial): Qt/Non-commercial Windows, Qt/Windows, Qt/X11, Qt/Mac, and
Qt/Embedded (or with modified versions of Qt that use the same license
as Qt), and distribute linked combinations including the two. You must
obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the code
used other than Qt. If you modify this file, you may extend this
exception to your version of the file, but you are not obligated to do
so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from
your version.


            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

2. License of 'MrSID Raster Plugin for GDAL'

LizardTech Computer Software License Agreement for MrSID Decode SDKs

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY.

This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or a
single entity, and hereinafter referred to as "Licensee") and Celartem, Inc., doing business as LizardTech
("LizardTech").

LIZARDTECH is engaged in the business of designing, developing, and marketing MrSID Decode SDKs (including
the GeoExpress Decode SDK and the LiDAR Compressor SDK) (collectively "DSDK"). DSDK consists of libraries
that allow licensees to write software, or engineer a process, that enables end-users to view MrSID-formatted files
and other supported file types.
LICENSEE desires to design, develop or market software products that use DSDK to permit (among other
functionality developed by LICENSEE) an end-user to view *. sid-formatted files and other supported formatted files
("Licensed Products").

In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants of this Agreement, LIZARDTECH agrees to license DSDK to
LICENSEE for LICENSEE's use in the development of Licensed Products, and LICENSEE's subsequent
sublicensing of DSDK with the Licensed Products pursuant to the terms and conditions which follow.

1. LICENSE GRANT
1.1 DSDK. DSDK and any and all associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation
provided with DSDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties, and is licensed, not sold. LICENSEE shall not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or
decompile or otherwise seek to discover the source code or trade secrets of DSDK. LICENSEE shall not use DSDK
to develop products or allow others to develop products that encode files into the MrSID format.
1.2 Development License Grant. LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive license to install DSDK
on a reasonable number of CPUs in LICENSEE's own facilities only for its own internal use and development of
Licensed Products that use DSDK to view *.sid files.
1.3 Distribution License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LIZARDTECH hereby grants to
LICENSEE a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable right to distribute DSDK in object code format with the
Licensed Products. For avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE is not permitted to distribute DSDK source code libraries.
LICENSEE may distribute DSDK with the Licensed Products to sublicensees (and such sublicensees may further
sublicense DSDK with the Licensed Products to other sublicensees) provided:
(a) a notice regarding LIZARDTECH or its licensors' ownership rights shall be provided with the Licensed Products
as set forth in Subsection 2.2 below;
(b) DSDK shall only be sublicensed under license terms as set forth in Subsection 1.3(d) below and any and all
distribution of DSDK with the Licensed Product does not cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, DSDK
to become subject to the terms of any Open Source license, including but not limited to the GNU Public License;
(c) any and all distribution of DSDK shall not (i) create, or purport to create, any obligations for LIZARDTECH or its
licensors with respect to DSDK; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under
LIZARDTECH or its licensors' intellectual property or proprietary rights in DSDK;
(d) DSDK shall be sublicensed to any and all sublicensees subject to a license agreement that provides
LIZARDTECH and its licensors with the same protections and requirements as set forth in Sections 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2, 3,
4, and 6.1. For the avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE and any and all sublicensees may not sublicense DSDK
separately from the Licensed Products.
1.4 Rights in DSDK. LIZARDTECH and its licensors retain all right, title to, and ownership of all applicable intellectual
property rights such as patent, copyrights and trade secrets in DSDK (including Updates as defined in Section 2.3)
and any associated documentation. Without limiting its rights in any way, LIZARDTECH hereby specifically reserves
the worldwide nonexclusive right to develop, use, reproduce and distribute DSDK directly to other integrators,
distributors and/or end-users. DSDK, including features and related information, are unpublished software, trade
secret, confidential or proprietary information of LIZARDTECH or its licensors. DSDK is a "commercial item," as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), any use, modification, reproduction,
release, performance, display, or disclosure of DSDK by the U. S. government shall be solely in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 1.3, LICENSEE shall not rent, sell, lease,
disclose or otherwise provide DSDK, associated documentation or any related information to any third party and will
use such efforts, and in no event less than a commercially reasonable effort, to protect DSDK, associated
documentation or related information as LICENSEE uses to protect its own trade secret, confidential or proprietary
information.

2. OBLIGATIONS OF LICENSEE
2.1 Trademark Usage. LIZARDTECH grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use and
display LIZARDTECH's trademarks, logos or other elements of its branding (collectively "Trademarks") in connection
with LICENSEE'S license rights granted hereunder with respect to DSDK, provided, however, such use shall be
subject to the terms in the Trademarks: Limited License provision located in the Terms of Use at
www.lizardtech.com. LICENSEE agrees to abide by such terms and LICENSEE further agrees to monitor the above
referenced Trademarks: Limited License provision for any updates or amendments to such terms.
2.2 Proprietary Rights Notice. LICENSEE must include in all Licensed Products all ownership/copyright, Trademark,
trade secret and other intellectual or proprietary rights notices accompanying the Licensed Products in the About Box
for all Licensed Products, or any other similar location where LICENSEE places proprietary rights notices pertaining
to third-party software incorporated in the Licensed Products. At a minimum, LICENSEE shall include the following
notice in all Licensed Products:
Portions of this computer program are copyright (c) 1995-2016 Celartem, Inc., doing business as LizardTech. All
rights reserved.
2.3 Licensed Product Support and Updates. LICENSEE is responsible for the support of all Licensed Products.
LICENSEE agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement Updates provided by LIZARDTECH into the
next scheduled release of the Licensed Products. LIZARDTECH may, but is not obligated to, provide such Updates
to DSDK. Updates shall mean maintenance revisions that correct identified errors in, or provide bug fixes for DSDK
and may also include support for additional file formats.

3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. LIZARDTECH AND ITS LICENSORS PROVIDE DSDK "AS IS" AND WITH ALL
FAULTS. LIZARDTECH, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THE DSDK,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF REASONABLE CARE OR
WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, OF RESULTS, OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE, OR OF A LACK OF VIRUSES, ALL WITH
REGARD TO DSDK. THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION,
CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION, AUTHORITY, OR NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO DSDK.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL LIZARDTECH OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, WHETHER RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, DATA, USE OR
REVENUE, OR FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation of liability shall apply
regardless of the form of action whether in contract or in tort, including by negligence or any other basis.

5. TERM AND TERMINATION
5.1 Term and Termination. The initial term of this Agreement will commence as of the Effective Date of this
Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if
the other party is in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within the thirty
(30) day period. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon the delivery of thirty (30) days prior
written notice of termination to the other party.
5.2 Obligations. Upon Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to LICENSEE shall
terminate and LICENSEE must return to LIZARDTECH or destroy all copies of DSDK in its possession, custody, or
control, whether modified or not. In the event this Agreement is terminated without cause, LICENSEE may (a) retain
a reasonable number of copies of Licensed Products, not to exceed five (5) copies, for purposes of its internal use
solely to facilitate customer support for existing customers only; and (b) exhaust its current stock of Licensed
Products over a period of no more than thirty (30) days after the date of termination. Any remaining inventory at the
end of such period must be destroyed.
5.3 Survival Provisions. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Sections 3, 4, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2, 6.3 and
6.6 of this Agreement survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

6. MISCELLANEOUS
6.1 Export Controls. LICENSEE shall not export or reexport DSDK or any direct product thereof without the
appropriate United States or foreign government export licenses, notifications or approvals.
6.2 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the
laws of the United States of America, and in the absence of applicable federal law, the laws of the State of Oregon
will apply. Further, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including but not limited to Section
6.2, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution), all claims, demands, complaints and disputes will be
subject to the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601-613), the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C.  1346(a) and  1491), or the
Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C.  1346(b), 2401-2402, 2671-2672, 2674-2680), as applicable, or other
applicable governing authority. For the avoidance of doubt, if LICENSEE is an agency of the federal government of
the United States, then LICENSEE's attorney fee obligations are only applicable to the extent they would not cause
LICENSEE to violate any applicable law (e.g., the Anti-Deficiency Act), and LICENSEE has any legally required
authorization or authorizing statute.
6.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement s sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to
the subject matter herein and merges all prior discussion(s) between them. No modification of or amendment to this
Agreement will be effective unless set forth in writing signed by officers of both parties hereto.
6.4 Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and either delivered by hand or
sent by prepaid, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by nationally recognized overnight courier
service, addressed to the other party at the address shown at the beginning of this Agreement or at such other
address for which such party gives notice hereunder. Such notice will be deemed to have been given when delivered
or, if delivery is not accomplished due to action or inaction of the addressee, when tendered.
6.5 Assignment and Binding Effect. LICENSEE may not transfer or assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of LIZARDTECH, except to a successor in interest or purchaser of all or
substantially all of LICENSEE's assets which specifically assumes the obligations of this Agreement. LICENSEE will
notify LIZARDTECH within ten (10) days of such event. Subject to the foregoing sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and assigns.
6.6 Partial Invalidity and No Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions will nevertheless remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to
renegotiate in good faith any term held invalid and to be bound by the mutually agreed substitute provision. No
waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement will be valid or binding on either party unless the same will have
been mutually assented to in writing by an officer of both parties. The failure of either party at any time to enforce any
of the provisions of the Agreement, or the failure to require at any time performance by the other party of any of the
provisions of this Agreement, will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in
any way affect the validity of an effort by either party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter.

5. License of 'ECW Raster Plugin for GDAL'

ERDAS ECW/JP2 Server Read-Only End-user SDK License Agreement

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK Server Read-Only
License Agreement ("License Agreement") is a legal agreement between You
(either an individual or a single legal entity) and Intergraph
Corporation, Hexagon Geospatial division of Intergraph (``Intergraph''),
for the SDK delivered with this License Agreement. By installing,
copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the SDK, You agree to
be bound by the terms of this License Agreement, which shall take
precedence over any other document and shall govern Your use of the SDK.
If You do not agree to the terms of this License Agreement, do not
install or use the SDK.  You agree that this License Agreement is
enforceable against You the same as any written, negotiated contract
signed by You.  If You do not agree to the terms of this License
Agreement, You are not authorized to, and You shall not, download,
install or use the SDK

 1.	DEFINITIONS

 1.1.	``CPU Core'' means a physical processor on a computer server that
can respond to and execute the basic instructions that drive the
computer. A Central Processing Unit (CPU) may have one or more cores,
and a given server may have multiple CPU sockets that may each contain
multiple cores.

 1.2.	``Decode'' means to view files compressed either using ECW
technology or JPEG2000 technology.

 1.3.	``Desktop Application'' means desktop software products that You
develop and that permit an end-user to Decode (among other functionality
You develop), and that are intended to be used as self-contained
programs for displaying and processing imagery on the same computing
device..

 1.4.	``ECW'' stands for Enhanced Compressed Wavelet.

 1.5.	``ECWP'' is the Enhanced Compressed Wavelet Protocol, by which ECW
and JPEG2000 files residing on a Server may be streamed to a Server
Application and Decoded.

 1.6.	``Encode'' means to compress data using ECW technology or to
otherwise compress using the SDK.

 1.7.	 ``Library'' means file of computing functions, compiled, linked,
and saved separately from the processes that use them, intended for use
by programmers in connection with their development of applications that
use the library.

 1.8.	``SDK'' means the Software Development Kit, that is, the set of
software development tools designed to facilitate development of Server
Applications using the SDK technologies currently marketed and licensed
by Intergraph as ECW/JP2 Server Read-Only End-user SDK, version 5.0 or
higher, consisting of libraries and supporting documents designed to
enable You to write software that enables You as the end-user to Decode
files but not to Encode files.  Among other things, the SDK enables
reading ECWP streams and enables decompression of files having an *.ecw
and *.jp2 extension.  The SDK includes the computer software, object
code copy and all contents of the files, disks, CD-ROMs or other media
with which this License Agreement is provided, including any templates,
printed materials, and online or electronic documentation, all copies,
and any modified versions, enhancements, fixes, patches, updates,  and
upgrades of the SDK, if any, licensed to You by Intergraph, unless a
particular modified version, enhancement, fix, patch, update,  or
upgrade is accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case
that license shall apply in accordance with its terms.  No source code
is included with the SDK.

 1.9.	``Server'' means a computing device in a network that is used to
provide services (such as access to files or shared peripherals or any
other computing function) to other computing devices in the network.

 1.10.	``Server Application'' means software products that You develop
or maintain and are capable of running on a Server to provide an image
decoding or processing capability.

 1.11.	``Virtualized CPU Core'' means a CPU Core deployed within a
virtual machine environment where the Server CPU Core count does not
reflect the physical CPU count on the host Server. The number of CPU
Cores present on the virtual machine shall reflect the number of CPU
Cores that must be licensed with the SDK.

 2.	LICENSE TO CREATE SERVER APPLICATIONS; PROHIBITED DEVELOPMENT;
APPLICABILITY TO UPGRADES; NO SUPPORT OBLIGATION

 2.1.	Subject to Your ongoing compliance with all of the terms of this
License Agreement, You are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive,
non-transferable license to operate a single copy of the SDK to embed
within a Server Application that Decodes files of any size but does not
Encode. You assume full responsibility for the implementation of the SDK
to achieve Your intended results, and for the installation, use and
results obtained from the SDK.

 2.2.	For avoidance of doubt, this License Agreement does not permit You
to (a) distribute Server Applications that include the SDK; (b)
distribute Desktop Applications that include the SDK; or; (c) distribute
files outside of the SDK `redistributable' directory; or (c) deploy any
application that combines multiple versions of the ECWSDK.

 2.3.	This Agreement applies to the original SDK received by You, and to
any bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications or enhancements provided
to You by Intergraph, unless a particular bug fix, update, upgrade,
modification or enhancement is accompanied by a different license
agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its
terms

 2.4.	This License Agreement does not entitle You to, and Intergraph
undertakes no obligation to provide, maintenance, support, modified
versions, enhancements, fixes, patches, updates, and upgrades to the
SDK.  Any support, maintenance or similar services that Intergraph makes
available would be provided under a separate agreement.





  3.	OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

 3.1.	No Reverse Engineering or Source Code Distribution.  Components of
the SDK used in Server Applications may be distributed for use in Your
organization only in object code or executable form. You shall not
decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse-engineer the SDK in an
attempt to discover its source code, or distribute any source code of
the SDK.  Likewise, You must inform Your organizational end-users of the
prohibition from reverse-engineering the SDK.

 3.2.	Core Restrictions. License fees and installation restrictions for
the SDK are based on the number of CPU Cores present in the Server on
which the SDK is to be installed. The SDK can be licensed in multiples
of four (4) CPU Cores. You are responsible for determining the number of
CPU Cores on your Server and ordering the appropriate number of CPU Core
licenses. For virtualized environments, the Virtualized CPU Core count
shall be used.

 3.3.	Server Restrictions. The SDK is licensed per Server and per CPU
Core. Additional SDK licenses must be purchased for additional Server
Application use. CPU Core counts cannot be shared across multiple
Servers. For example, You may not share one 16 CPU Core license between
two 8 CPU Core Servers.

 3.4.	Intergraph Proprietary Rights Notice. You must include the
following statement of ownership/copyright notice in the ``About'' box
for each of Your Server Applications, or any other similar location
where You place proprietary rights notices pertaining to third party
software incorporated in the Server Application:

``This application supports the ECW data format and ECWP compression

 11.	BETA SOFTWARE

If the SDK You received with this License Agreement is pre-commercial
release or beta software (``Beta Software''), then the following
additional terms apply.  To the extent that any provision in this
section is in conflict with any other terms or conditions in this
License Agreement, this section shall supersede such other terms and
conditions with respect to the Beta Software, but only to the extent
necessary to resolve the conflict.  You shall hold all information
concerning Beta Software and Your use and evaluation of such information
and the Beta Software (collectively, ``Beta Software Information'') in
confidence and with the same degree of care You use to keep Your own
similar information confidential, but in no event shall You use less
than a reasonable degree of care; and You shall not, without the prior
written consent of Intergraph, disclose such Beta Software Information
to any person or entity for any reason at any time; provided, however,
it is understood that You may disclose any Beta Software Information to
those of Your representatives who actually need such information for the
purpose of participating in the proposed evaluation and testing (``Beta
Testing'') of the Beta Software, on the condition that, prior to such
disclosure, such representative has been made aware of the terms of this
License Agreement. You shall not use any Beta Software Information for
any reason or purpose other than as necessary for Beta Testing.  You
agree to make no other use of the Beta Software Information or to
incorporate any Beta Software Information into any work or product.  You

not represent final product from Intergraph, and may contain bugs,
errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and
data loss.  THE BETA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU ``AS-IS'', AND
INTERGRAPH DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTY AND LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU OF
ANY KIND.  You may use the Beta Software only for evaluation and testing
and not for general production use.  You acknowledge that Intergraph has
not promised or guaranteed to you that Beta Software or any portion
thereof will be announced or made available to anyone in the future,
Intergraph has no express or implied obligation to You to announce or
introduce the Beta Software and that Intergraph may not introduce a
product similar to or compatible with the Beta Software.  Accordingly,
You acknowledge that any research or development that You perform
regarding the Beta Software or any product associated with the Beta
Software is done entirely at Your own risk.  During the term of this
License Agreement, if requested by Intergraph, You will provide feedback
to Intergraph regarding Beta Testing, including error or bug reports.
Upon receipt of a later unreleased version of Beta Software or release
by Intergraph of a publicly released commercial version of the SDK, You
agree to return or permanently destroy all earlier Beta Software
received from Intergraph.  You agree that You will return or destroy all
unreleased versions of the Beta Software within thirty (30) days of the
completion of Beta Testing when such date is earlier than the date for
Intergraph's first commercial shipment of the publicly released
commercial software.
