# Rana Desktop Client Installer

This repository contains a Makefile (which should be run in the accompanying docker container) that does the following:

- Downloads a specific complete QGIS installer 
- Uses NSIS to wrap this in a global installer that:
    - Silently installs QGIS (via its original installer) in a configurable directory (no QGIS shortcuts and links, and only possible with admin rights) and generates relevant start/desktop shortcuts
    - Optionally:
        - Copies preconfigured profile data (ini files) to the user's AppData for customization (including splash screen)
        - Adds N&S toolboxes (downloaded from plugins.lizard.net) and external toolboxes (downloaded from plugins.qgis.org)

Usage
------

The versions of QGIS and the (internal and external) plugins are hardcoded in the Makefile. When creating a new installer, update 
these versions to the desired version.

Note that non-LTR releases might have a different internal folder or file naming (e.g "apps/qgis-ltr" vs "apps/qgis", "qgis-ltr.bat" vs "qgis.bat"). This is not automatically detected and the installer script might need to be adjusted to deal with this.

The current license text (LICENSE.txt) is directly copied from the LTR QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.34.5-1 installer UI. In case QGIS or the dependencies are updated, update this text as well.

Check out the repo in a clean folder::

    $ mkdir /tmp/reallyclean
    $ cd /tmp/reallyclean
    $ git clone git@github.com:nens/threedi-modeller-interface-installer.git
    $ cd threedi-modeller-interface-installer

    Build (if required) and run the container:  
    $ docker build . -t rana-installer
    $ docker run -w /app/ -v "$(pwd):/app" -it rana-installer make installer

The executable will be in the root folder.

Deploy
------

The installer can be uploaded to https://artifacts.lizard.net/. The Makefile contains a build recipe for this that
uses ``upload-rana-desktop-client.sh``. You'll need to set the ``$RANA_ARTIFACTS_KEY`` environment variable

    $ make upload
